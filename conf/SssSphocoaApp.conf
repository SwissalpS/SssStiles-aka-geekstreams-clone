 * We recommend having a webapp.conf.dev and a webapp.conf.production in your RCS, and simply changing the filename of the one you want to
 * use to webapp.conf on each machine.
 *
 * Configurable elements that don't change based on deployment are typically done via the WFWebApplication and its delegate.
