Enabling IRC users to share a viewing experience.

Most of this code is cloned from geekstreams.appspot.com, at least the code
anyone can fetch with a browser.

The idea was conceived, as far as I know, in the #fmcg channel on freenode.net
So by definition it is a collaborative creation.

Users of the channel can enter commands to change the layout and contents of
the webpage.

This package deals with the server-side.

For client-side see my proof of concept gist https://gist.github.com/1097242

For now the server-side is using plist files just to prove how the system is to
work. For production I recommend using a database such as mySQL.
